Preprocessors are additional packages that, well, preprocess the source code of your project. You can do all kinds of stuff with preprocessors: include remote Markdown files or their parts in the source files render diagrams from textual description on build restructure the project source or compile it into a single file for a particular backend In fact, you have already used two preprocessors! Check the output of the foliant make commands and note the lines Applying preprocessor mkdocs and Applying preprocessor flatten . The first one informs you that the project source has been preprocessed with mkdocs preprocessor in order to make it compatible with MkDocs\u2019 requirements, and the second one tells you that flatten preprocessor was used to squash the project source into one a single file (because Pandoc only works with single files). These preprocessors where called by MkDocs and Pandoc backends respectively. You didn\u2019t have to install or activate them explicitly. Now, let\u2019s try to use a different kind of preprocessors, the ones that register new tags: Blockdiag . Embed Diagrams with Blockdiag \u00b6 Blockdiag is a Python app for generating diagrams. Blockdiag preprocessor extracts diagram descriptions from the project source and replaces them with the generated images. In hello.md , add the following lines: Foliant doesn\u2019t force any *special* Markdown flavor. + <seqdiag caption=\"This diagram is generated on the fly\"> + seqdiag { + \"foliant make site\" -> \"mkdocs preprocessor\" -> \"blockdiag preprocessor\" -> \"mkdocs backend\" -> site; + } + </seqdiag> Blockdiag preprocessor adds several tags to Foliant, each corresponding to a certain diagram type. Sequence diagrams are defined with <seqdiag></seqdiag> tag. This is what we used in the sample above. The diagram definition sits in the tag body and the diagram properties such as caption or format are defined as tag parameters. Rebuild the site with foliant make site and open it in the browser: Rebuild the pdf as well and see that the diagram there: Let\u2019s customize the look of the diagrams in our project by setting their properties in the config file. For example, let\u2019s use a custom font for labels. I\u2019m using the ever popular Comic Sans font, but you can pick any font that\u2019s available in .ttf format. Put the font file in the project directory and add the following lines to foliant.yml : preprocessors: - - blockdiag + - blockdiag: + params: + font: !path comic.ttf After a rebuild, the diagram on the site and in the pdf should look like this: There are many more params you can define for your diagrams. You can override global params for particluar diagrams in their tags. And by combining this preprocessor with Flags you can even set different params for different backends, for example build vector diagrams for pdf output and bitmap for site: This is a diagram that is rendered to `. png ` in html and to `. pdf ` in pdf : << blockdiag format = \" <if targets= \" html \" >png</if><<if targets= \" pdf \" >pdf</if \" > ... </ blockdiag > The possibilities acquired by combining different preprocessors are endless! Why Foliant Uses XML syntax for Preprocessor Tags It\u2019s common for Markdown-based tools to extend Markdown with custom syntax for additional functions. There\u2019s no standard for custom syntax in the Markdown spec, so every developer uses whatever syntax is available for them, different one for every new extension. In Foliant, we tried our best not to dive into this mess. Foliant aims to be an extensible platform, with many available preprocessors. So we needed one syntax for all preprocessors, but the one that was flexible enough to support them all. After trying many options, we settled with XML. Yes, normally you\u2019d have a nervous tick when you hear XML, and so would we, but this is one rare case where XML syntax belongs just right: it allows to provide tag body and named parameters it\u2019s familiar to every techwriter out there it\u2019s close enough to HTML, and HTML tags are actually allowed by the Markdown spec, so we\u2019re not even breaking the vanilla Markdown spec (almost) it\u2019s nicely highlighted in IDEs and text editors","title":"Quickstart"},{"location":"quickstart/#quickstart","text":"In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to use Foliant to build websites and pdf documents from a single Markdown source.

Preprocessors are additional packages that, well, preprocess the source code of your project. You can do all kinds of stuff with preprocessors: include remote Markdown files or their parts in the source files render diagrams from textual description on build restructure the project source or compile it into a single file for a particular backend In fact, you have already used two preprocessors! Check the output of the foliant make commands and note the lines Applying preprocessor mkdocs and Applying preprocessor flatten . The first one informs you that the project source has been preprocessed with mkdocs preprocessor in order to make it compatible with MkDocs\u2019 requirements, and the second one tells you that flatten preprocessor was used to squash the project source into one a single file (because Pandoc only works with single files). These preprocessors where called by MkDocs and Pandoc backends respectively. You didn\u2019t have to install or activate them explicitly. Now, let\u2019s try to use a different kind of preprocessors, the ones that register new tags: Blockdiag .","title":"Use Preprocessors"},{"location":"quickstart/#embed-diagrams-with-blockdiag","text":"Blockdiag is a Python app for generating diagrams. Blockdiag preprocessor extracts diagram descriptions from the project source and replaces them with the generated images. In hello.md , add the following lines: Foliant doesn\u2019t force any *special* Markdown flavor. + <seqdiag caption=\"This diagram is generated on the fly\"> + seqdiag { + \"foliant make site\" -> \"mkdocs preprocessor\" -> \"blockdiag preprocessor\" -> \"mkdocs backend\" -> site; + } + </seqdiag> Blockdiag preprocessor adds several tags to Foliant, each corresponding to a certain diagram type. Sequence diagrams are defined with <seqdiag></seqdiag> tag. This is what we used in the sample above. The diagram definition sits in the tag body and the diagram properties such as caption or format are defined as tag parameters. Rebuild the site with foliant make site and open it in the browser: Rebuild the pdf as well and see that the diagram there: Let\u2019s customize the look of the diagrams in our project by setting their properties in the config file. For example, let\u2019s use a custom font for labels. I\u2019m using the ever popular Comic Sans font, but you can pick any font that\u2019s available in .ttf format. Put the font file in the project directory and add the following lines to foliant.yml : preprocessors: - - blockdiag + - blockdiag: + params: + font: !path comic.ttf After a rebuild, the diagram on the site and in the pdf should look like this: There are many more params you can define for your diagrams. You can override global params for particluar diagrams in their tags. And by combining this preprocessor with Flags you can even set different params for different backends, for example build vector diagrams for pdf output and bitmap for site: This is a diagram that is rendered to `. png ` in html and to `. pdf ` in pdf : << blockdiag format = \" <if targets= \" html \" >png</if><<if targets= \" pdf \" >pdf</if \" > ... </ blockdiag > The possibilities acquired by combining different preprocessors are endless! Why Foliant Uses XML syntax for Preprocessor Tags It\u2019s common for Markdown-based tools to extend Markdown with custom syntax for additional functions. There\u2019s no standard for custom syntax in the Markdown spec, so every developer uses whatever syntax is available for them, different one for every new extension. In Foliant, we tried our best not to dive into this mess. Foliant aims to be an extensible platform, with many available preprocessors. So we needed one syntax for all preprocessors, but the one that was flexible enough to support them all. After trying many options, we settled with XML. Yes, normally you\u2019d have a nervous tick when you hear XML, and so would we, but this is one rare case where XML syntax belongs just right: it allows to provide tag body and named parameters it\u2019s familiar to every techwriter out there it\u2019s close enough to HTML, and HTML tags are actually allowed by the Markdown spec, so we\u2019re not even breaking the vanilla Markdown spec (almost) it\u2019s nicely highlighted in IDEs and text editors","title":"Embed Diagrams with Blockdiag"},{"location":"releases/","text":"History of Releases \u00b6 Here is the single linear history of releases of Foliant and its extensions.

Installation \u00b6 $ pip install foliantcontrib.apilinks Quick Start \u00b6 Say, you have an API documentation hosted at the url http://example.com/api-docs On this page you have HTML headings before each method description which look like this: < h2 id = \"get-user-authenticate\" > GET user/authenticate </ h2 > You want references to these methods in your documentation to be replaced with the links to the actual method descriptions. Your references look like this: To authenticate user use API method ` GET user / authenticate ` . Now all you need to do is add the apilinks preprocessor into your foliant.yml and state your API url in its options like this: preprocessors : - apilinks : API : My-API : url : http://example.com/api-docs Here: API is a required section; My-API is a local name of your API. Right now it is not very important but will come in handy in the next example; url is a string with full url to your API documentation web-page. It will be used to validate references and to construct a link to method. After foliant applies the preprocessor your document will be transformed into this: To authenticate user use API method [ GET user / authenticate ]( http : // example . com / api - docs /# get - user - authenticate ). Notice that preprocessor figured out the correct anchor #get-user-authenticate by himself. Now instead of plain name of the method you've got a link to the method description! Ok, what if I have two different APIs: client API and admin API? No problem, put both of them into your config: preprocessors : - apilinks : API : Client-API : url : http://example.com/client/api-docs Admin-API : url : http://example.com/admin/api-docs Now this source: To authenticate user use API method ` GET user / authenticate ` . To ban user from the website use admin API method ` POST admin / ban_user / { user_id } ` Will be transformed by apilinks into this: To authenticate user use API method [ GET user / authenticate ]( http : // example . com / client / api - docs /# get - user - authenticate ). To ban user from the website use admin API method [ POST admin / ban_user / { user_id } ]( http : // example . com / admin / api - docs /# post - admin - ban_user - user_id ) Notice that apilinks determined that the first reference is from Client API, and the second one is from the Admin API. How is that possible? Easy: preprocessor parses each API url from the config and stores their methods before looking for references. When the time comes to process the references it already has a list of all methods to validate your reference and to determine which API link should be inserted. But what if we have the same-named method in both of our APIs? In this case you will see a warning: WARNING : GET /service/ healthcheck is present in several APIs ( Client - API , Admin - API ). Please , use prefix . Skipping It suggests us to use prefix, and by that it means to prefix the reference by the local name of the API in config. Like that: Check status of the server through Client API : ` Client - API : GET / service / healthcheck ` Do the same through Admin API : ` Admin - API : GET / service / healthcheck ` Here Client-API: and Admin-API: are prefixes. And they should be the same as your API names in the config. Now each reference will be replaced with the link to corresponding API web-page. apilinks is a highly customizable preprocessor. You can tune: the format of the references; the output string which will replace the reference; the format of the headings in your API web-page; and more! For details look through the following sections. Glossary: reference \u2014 reference to an API method in the source file. The one to be replaced with the link, e.g. GET user/config verb \u2014 HTTP method, e.g. GET , POST , etc. command \u2014 resource used to represent method on the API documentation webpage, e.g. /service/healthcheck . endpoint prefix \u2014 A prefix from server root to the command. If the command is /user/status and full resource is /api/v0/user/satus then the endpoint-prefix should be stated /api/v0 . In references you can use either full resource ( {endpoint_prefix}/{command} ) or just the command. apilinks will sort it out for you. output \u2014 string, which will replace the reference . header \u2014 HTML header on the API documentation web-page of the method description, e.g. <h2 id=\"get-user-config\">GET user/config</h2> anchor \u2014 web-anchor leading to the specific header on the API documentation web-page, e.g. #get-user-config How Does It Work? \u00b6 Preprocessor can work in online and offline modes. In offline mode it merely replaces references to API methods with links to their description. The references are catched by a regular expression. The link url is taken from config and the link anchor is generated from the reference automatically. You can have several different APIs stated in the config. You can use prefixes to point out which API is being reference d. Prefixes format may be customized in the configuration but by default you do it like this: Client-API: GET user/name . Here ' Client-API ' is a prefix. If you don't use prefix in the reference preprocessor will suppose that you meant the default API, which is marked by default option in config. If none of them is marked \u2014 goes for the first in list. In online mode things are getting interesting. Preprocessor actually goes to each of the API web-pages, and collects all method headers (right now only h2 headers are supported). Then it goes through your document's source: when it meets a reference , it looks through all the collected methods and replaces the reference with the correct link to it. If method is not found \u2014 preprocessor will show warning and leave the reference unchanged. Same will happen if there are several methods with this name in different APIs. Prefixes, explained before, are supported too. Config \u00b6 To enable the preprocessor, add apilinks to preprocessors section in the project config: preprocessors : - apilinks The preprocessor has a lot of options. For your convenience the required options are marked (required) ; and those options which are used in customization are marked (optional) . Most likely you will need just one or two of the latter. preprocessors : - apilinks : targets : - site offline : False trim_if_targets : - pdf prefix_to_ignore : Ignore reference : - regex : *ref_pattern only_with_prefixes : false only_defined_prefixes : true output_template : '[{verb} {command}]({url})' trim_template : '`{verb} {command}`' API : Client-API : url : http://example.com/api/client default : true header_template : '{verb} {command}' Admin-API : url : http://example.com/api/client header_template : '{command}' endpoint-prefix : /api/v0 prefix_to_ignore (optional) A default prefix for ignoring references. If apilinks meets a reference with this prefix it leaves it unchanged. Default: Ignore targets (optional) List of supported targets for foliant make command. If target is not listed here \u2014 preprocessor won't be applied. If the list is empty \u2014 preprocessor will be applied for any target. Default: [] offline (optional) Option determining whether the preprocessor will work in online or offline mode. Details in the How Does It Work? and Online and Offline Modes Comparison sections. Default: False trim_if_targets (optional) List of targets for foliant make command for which the prefixes from all references in the text will be cut out. Default: [] Only those references whose prefixes are defined in the API section (described below) are affected by this option. All references with unlisted prefixes will not be trimmed. reference (optional) A subsection for listing all the types of references you are going to catch in the text, and their properties. Options for this section are listed below. Reference options regex (optional) regular expression used to catch references in the source. Look for details in the Capturing References section. Default: ( ? P < source > ` (( ? P < prefix > [\\ w - ] + ) :\\ s * ) ? ( ? P < verb > OPTIONS | GET | HEAD | POST | PUT | DELETE | TRACE | CONNECT | PATCH | LINK | UNLINK ) \\ s + ( ? P < command > \\ S + ) ` ) only_with_prefixes (optional) if this is true , only references with prefix will be transformed. Ordinary links like GET user/info will be ignored. Default: false only_defined_prefixes (optional) if this is true all references whose prefix is not listed in the API section (described below) will be ignored, left unchanged. References without prefix are not affected by this option. Default: false . output_template (optional) A template string describing the output which will replace the reference . More info in the Customizing Output section. Default: '[{verb} {command}]({url})' trim_template (optional) Only for targets listed in trim_if_targets option. Tune this template if you want to customize how apilinks cuts out prefixes. The reference will be replaced with text based on this template. Default: '`{verb} {command}`' API (required) A subsection for listing all the APIs and their properties. Under this section there should be a separate subsection for each API. The section name represents the API name and, at the same time, the prefix used in the references. You need to add at least one API subsection for preprocessor to work. API properties url (required) An API documentation web-page URL. It will be used to construct the full link to the method. In online mode it will also be parsed by preprocessor for validation. default (optional) Only for offline mode. Marker to define the default API. If several APIs are marked default, preprocessor will choose the first of them. If none is marked default \u2014 the first API in the list will be chosen. The value of this item should be true . header_template (optional) A template string describing the format of the headings in the API documentation web-page. Details in parsing API web-page section. Default: '{verb} {command}' endpoint-prefix (optional) The endpoint prefix from the server root to API methods. If is stated \u2014 apilinks can divide the command in the reference and search for it more accurately. Also you could use it in templates. More info coming soon. Default: '' Online and Offline Modes Comparison \u00b6 Let's study an example and look how the behavior of the preprocessor will change in online and offline modes. We have three APIs described in the config: preprocessors : - apilinks : API : Admin-API : url : http://example.com/api/client Client-API : url : http://example.com/api/client default : true header_template : '{verb} {command}' Remote-API : url : https://remote.net/api-ref/ header_template : '{command}' Now let's look at different examples of the text used in Markdown source and how it is going to be transformed in Offline and Online modes Example 1 Source: Unprefixed link which only exists in Remote API : ` GET system / info ` . In Offline mode preprocessor won't do any checks and just replace the reference with the link to default API from the config: Unprefixed link which only exists in Remote API : [ GET system / info ]( http : // example . com / api / client /# get - system - info ). This is certainly a wrong decision, but it is our fault, we sould have added the prefix to the reference. But let's look what will happen in Online mode : Unprefixed link which only exists in Remote API : [ GET system / info ]( https : // remote . net / api - ref /# system - info ). Without any prefix the preprocessor determined that it should choose the Remote API to replace this reference because this method exists only on its page. The default option is just ignored in this mode. By the way, notice how anchors differ in the two examples. For Remote API preprocessor used its header template to reconstruct the anchor, dropping the verb from it. Example 2 Source: Unprefixed link with misprint : ` GET user / sttus ` . The link is incorrect , there ' s no such method in any of the APIs . In Offline mode preprocessor won't do any checks again. No magic, the reference will be replaced with the link to default API from the config: Unprefixed link with misprint : [ GET user / sttus ]( http : // example . com / api / client /# get - user - sttus ). The link is incorrect , there ' s no such method in any of the APIs . In Online mode preprocessor won't be able to find the method during validation and the reference won't be replaced at all: Unprefixed link with misprint : ` GET user / sttus ` . The link is incorrect , there ' s no such method in any of the APIs . During the Foliant project assembly you will see a warning message: WARNING : Cannot find method GET user / sttus . Skipping Example 3 Source: Prefixed link to the Admin API : ` Admin - API : POST user / ban_forever ` . In Offline mode preprocessor will notice the prefix and will be able to replace the reference with an appropriate link: Prefixed link to the Admin API : [ POST user / ban_forever ]( http : // example . com / api / client /# post - user - ban_forever ). Notice that prefix disappeared from the text. If you wish it to stay there \u2014 edit the output_template option to something like this: '{prefix}: {verb} {command}' . In Online mode the result will be exactly the same. Preprocessor will check the Admin-API methods, find there the referenced method and replace it in the text: Prefixed link to the Admin API : [ POST user / ban_forever ]( http : // example . com / api / client /# post - user - ban_forever ). Example 4 Prefixed link to the Remote API with a misprint : ` Remote - API : GET billling / info ` . Oh no , the method is incorrect again . In Offline mode preprocessor will perform no checks and just replace the reference with the link to Remote API: Prefixed link to the Remote API with a misprint : [ GET billling / info ]( https : // remote . net / api - ref /# get - billling - info ). Oh no , the method is incorrect again . Online mode , on the other hand, will make its homework. It will check whether the Remote API actually has the method GET billling/info . Finding out that it hasn't it will leave the reference unchanged: Prefixed link to the Remote API with a misprint : ` Remote - API : GET billling / info ` . Oh no , the method is incorrect again . ...and warn us with the message: WARNING : Cannot find method GET billling / info in Remote - API . Skipping Example 5 Now let ' s reference a method which is present in both Client and Admin APIs : ` GET service / healthcheck ` . In Offline mode preprocessor will just replace the reference with a link to default API: Now let ' s reference a method which is present in both Client and Admin APIs : [ GET service / healthcheck ]( http : // example . com / api / client /# get - service - healthcheck ). But in Online mode preprocessor will go through all API method lists. It will find several mentions of this exact method and, confused, won't replace the reference at all: Now let ' s reference a method which is present in both Client and Admin APIs : ` GET service / healthcheck ` . You will also see a warning: WARNING : GET /service/ healthcheck is present in several APIs ( Admin - API , Client - API ). Please , use prefix . Skipping Capturing References \u00b6 apilinks uses regular expressions to capture references to API methods in Markdown files. The default reg-ex is as following: ( ? P < source > ` (( ? P < prefix > [\\ w - ] + ) :\\ s * ) ? ( ? P < verb > OPTIONS | GET | HEAD | POST | PUT | DELETE | TRACE | CONNECT | PATCH | LINK | UNLINK ) \\ s + ( ? P < command > \\ S + ) ` ) This expression accepts references like these: Client-API: GET user/info UPDATE user/details Notice that default expression uses Named Capturing Groups . You would probably want to use all of them too if you are to redefine the expression. Though not all of them are required, see the table below. Group Required Description source YES The full original reference string prefix NO Prefix pointing to the name of the API from config verb NO HTTP verb as GET , POST , etc command YES the full method resource as it is stated in the API header (may include endpoint prefix) To redefine the regular expression add an option reg-regex to the preprocessor config. For example, if you want to capture ONLY references with prefixes you may use the following: preprocessors : - apilinks : reference : - regex : '(?P<source>`((?P<prefix>[\\w-]+):\\s*)(?P<verb>POST|GET|PUT|UPDATE|DELETE)\\s+(?P<command>\\S+)`)' This example is for illustrative purposes only. You can achieve the same goal by just switching on the only_with_prefixes option. Now the references without prefix ( UPDATE user/details ) will be ignored. Customizing Output \u00b6 You can customize the output -string which will replace the reference string. To do that add a template into your config-file. A template is a string which may contain properties, surrounded by curly braces. These properties will be replaced with the values, and all the rest will remain unchanged. For example, look at the default template: preprocessors : - apilinks : reference : - output_template : '[{verb} {command}]({url})' , Don't forget the single quotes around the template. This way we say to yaml engine that this is a string for it not to be confused with curly braces. With the default template, the reference string will be replaced by something like that: [ GET user / info ]( http : // example . com / api /# get - user - info ) If you don't want references to be transfromed into links, use your own template. Properties you may use in the template: property description example url Full url to the method description http://example.com/api/#get-user-info source Full original reference string ` Client-API: GET user/info ` prefix Prefix used in the reference Client-API verb HTTP verb used in the reference GET command API command being referenced with endpoint prefix removed user/info endpoint_prefix Endpoint prefix to the API (if endpoint-prefix option is filled in) /api/v0 Parsing API Web-page \u00b6 apilinks goes through the API web-page content and gathers all the methods which are described there. To do this preprocessor scans each HTML h2 tag and stores its id attribute (which is an anchor of the link to be constructed) and the contents of the tag (the heading itself). For example in this link: < h2 id = \"get-user-info\" > GET user/info </ h2 > the anchor would be get-user-info and the heading would be GET user/info . To construct the link to the method description we will have to create the correct anchor for it. To create an anchor we would need to reconstruct the heading first. But the heading format may be arbitrary and that's why we need the header_template config option. The header_template is a string which may contain properties, surrounded by curly braces. These properties will be replaced with the values, when preprocessor will attempt to reconstruct the heading. All the rest will remain unchanged. For example, if your API headings look like this: <h2 id= \"method-user-info-get\" > Method user/info (GET) </h2> You should use the following option: ... API : Client-API : header_template : 'Method {command} ({verb})' ... Don't forget the single quotes around the template. This way we say to yaml engine that this is a string. If your headers do not have a verb at all: <h2 id= \"user-info\" > user/info </h2> You should use the following option: ... API : Client-API : header_template : '{command}' ... Properties you may use in the template: property description example verb HTTP verb used in the reference GET command API command being referenced user/info endpoint_prefix Endpoint prefix to the API (if endpoint-prefix option is filled in) /api/v0","title":"APILinks"},{"location":"preprocessors/apilinks/#apilinks","text":"Preprocessor for replacing API reference s in markdown files with links to actual method description on the API documentation web-page.","title":"APILinks"},{"location":"preprocessors/apilinks/#installation","text":"$ pip install foliantcontrib.apilinks","title":"Installation"},{"location":"preprocessors/apilinks/#quick-start","text":"Say, you have an API documentation hosted at the url http://example.com/api-docs On this page you have HTML headings before each method description which look like this: < h2 id = \"get-user-authenticate\" > GET user/authenticate </ h2 > You want references to these methods in your documentation to be replaced with the links to the actual method descriptions. Your references look like this: To authenticate user use API method ` GET user / authenticate ` . Now all you need to do is add the apilinks preprocessor into your foliant.yml and state your API url in its options like this: preprocessors : - apilinks : API : My-API : url : http://example.com/api-docs Here: API is a required section; My-API is a local name of your API. Right now it is not very important but will come in handy in the next example; url is a string with full url to your API documentation web-page. It will be used to validate references and to construct a link to method. After foliant applies the preprocessor your document will be transformed into this: To authenticate user use API method [ GET user / authenticate ]( http : // example . com / api - docs /# get - user - authenticate ). Notice that preprocessor figured out the correct anchor #get-user-authenticate by himself. Now instead of plain name of the method you've got a link to the method description! Ok, what if I have two different APIs: client API and admin API? No problem, put both of them into your config: preprocessors : - apilinks : API : Client-API : url : http://example.com/client/api-docs Admin-API : url : http://example.com/admin/api-docs Now this source: To authenticate user use API method ` GET user / authenticate ` . To ban user from the website use admin API method ` POST admin / ban_user / { user_id } ` Will be transformed by apilinks into this: To authenticate user use API method [ GET user / authenticate ]( http : // example . com / client / api - docs /# get - user - authenticate ). To ban user from the website use admin API method [ POST admin / ban_user / { user_id } ]( http : // example . com / admin / api - docs /# post - admin - ban_user - user_id ) Notice that apilinks determined that the first reference is from Client API, and the second one is from the Admin API. How is that possible? Easy: preprocessor parses each API url from the config and stores their methods before looking for references. When the time comes to process the references it already has a list of all methods to validate your reference and to determine which API link should be inserted. But what if we have the same-named method in both of our APIs? In this case you will see a warning: WARNING : GET /service/ healthcheck is present in several APIs ( Client - API , Admin - API ). Please , use prefix . Skipping It suggests us to use prefix, and by that it means to prefix the reference by the local name of the API in config. Like that: Check status of the server through Client API : ` Client - API : GET / service / healthcheck ` Do the same through Admin API : ` Admin - API : GET / service / healthcheck ` Here Client-API: and Admin-API: are prefixes. And they should be the same as your API names in the config. Now each reference will be replaced with the link to corresponding API web-page. apilinks is a highly customizable preprocessor. You can tune: the format of the references; the output string which will replace the reference; the format of the headings in your API web-page; and more!

Now the references without prefix ( UPDATE user/details ) will be ignored.","title":"Capturing References"},{"location":"preprocessors/apilinks/#customizing-output","text":"You can customize the output -string which will replace the reference string. To do that add a template into your config-file. A template is a string which may contain properties, surrounded by curly braces. These properties will be replaced with the values, and all the rest will remain unchanged. For example, look at the default template: preprocessors : - apilinks : reference : - output_template : '[{verb} {command}]({url})' , Don't forget the single quotes around the template. This way we say to yaml engine that this is a string for it not to be confused with curly braces. With the default template, the reference string will be replaced by something like that: [ GET user / info ]( http : // example . com / api /# get - user - info ) If you don't want references to be transfromed into links, use your own template. Properties you may use in the template: property description example url Full url to the method description http://example.com/api/#get-user-info source Full original reference string ` Client-API: GET user/info ` prefix Prefix used in the reference Client-API verb HTTP verb used in the reference GET command API command being referenced with endpoint prefix removed user/info endpoint_prefix Endpoint prefix to the API (if endpoint-prefix option is filled in) /api/v0","title":"Customizing Output"},{"location":"preprocessors/apilinks/#parsing-api-web-page","text":"apilinks goes through the API web-page content and gathers all the methods which are described there. To do this preprocessor scans each HTML h2 tag and stores its id attribute (which is an anchor of the link to be constructed) and the contents of the tag (the heading itself). For example in this link: < h2 id = \"get-user-info\" > GET user/info </ h2 > the anchor would be get-user-info and the heading would be GET user/info . To construct the link to the method description we will have to create the correct anchor for it. To create an anchor we would need to reconstruct the heading first. But the heading format may be arbitrary and that's why we need the header_template config option. The header_template is a string which may contain properties, surrounded by curly braces. These properties will be replaced with the values, when preprocessor will attempt to reconstruct the heading. All the rest will remain unchanged. For example, if your API headings look like this: <h2 id= \"method-user-info-get\" > Method user/info (GET) </h2> You should use the following option: ... API : Client-API : header_template : 'Method {command} ({verb})' ... Don't forget the single quotes around the template. This way we say to yaml engine that this is a string. If your headers do not have a verb at all: <h2 id= \"user-info\" > user/info </h2> You should use the following option: ... API : Client-API : header_template : '{command}' ...

EscapeCode saves raw content parts into files. Later, UnescapeCode restores this content from files. Also, before the replacement, EscapeCode normalizes the source Markdown content to unify and simplify further operations. The preprocessor replaces CRLF with LF , removes excessive whitespace characters, provides trailing newline, etc. Installation \u00b6 To install EscapeCode and UnescapeCode preprocessors, run: $ pip install foliantcontrib.includes See more details below. Integration with Foliant and Includes \u00b6 You may call EscapeCode and UnescapeCode explicitly, but these preprocessors are integrated with Foliant core (since version 1.0.10) and with Includes preprocessor (since version 1.1.1). The escape_code project\u2019s config option, if set to true , provides applying EscapeCode before all other preprocessors, and applying UnescapeCode after all other preprocessors. Also this option tells Includes preprocessor to apply EscapeCode to each included file. In this mode EscapeCode and UnescapeCode preprocessors deprecate _unescape preprocessor. > ** Note ** > > The preprocessor _unescape is a part of Foliant core . It allows to use pseudo - XML tags in code examples . If you want an opening tag not to be interpreted by any preprocessor , precede this tag with the ` < ` character . The preprocessor _unescape applies after all other preprocessors and removes such characters . Config example: title : My Awesome Project chapters : - index.md ... escape_code : true preprocessors : ... - includes ... ... If the escape_code option isn\u2019t used or set to false , backward compatibility mode is involved. In this mode EscapeCode and UnescapeCode aren\u2019t applied automatically, but _unescape preprocessor is applied. The Python package that includes EscapeCode and UnescapeCode preprocessors is the dependence of Includes preprocessor since version 1.1.1. At the same time this package isn\u2019t a dependence of Foliant core. To use escape_code config option in Foliant core, you have to install the package with EscapeCode and UnescapeCode preprocessors separately. Explicit Enabling \u00b6 You may not to use the escape_code option and call the preprocessors explicitly: preprocessors : - escapecode # usually the first list item ... - unescapecode # usually the last list item Both preprocessors allow to override the path to the directory that is used to store temporary files: preprocessors : - escapecode : cache_dir : !path .escapecodecache ... - unescapecode : cache_dir : !path .escapecodecache The default values are shown in this example. EscapeCode and related UnescapeCode must work with the same cache directory. Note that if you use Includes preprocessor, and the included content doesn\u2019t belong to the current Foliant project, there\u2019s no way to escape raw parts of this content before Includes preprocessor is applied. Usage \u00b6 Below you can see an example of Markdown content with code blocks and inline code. # Heading Text that contains some `inline code` . Below is a fence code block , language is optional : `` ` python import this `` ` One more fence code block : ~~~ # This is a comment that should not be interpreted as a heading print ( 'Hello World' ) ~~~ And this is a pre code block : mov dx , hello ; mov ah , 9 ; int 21 h ; The preprocessor EscapeCode will do the following replacements: # Heading Text that contains some <escaped hash= \"2bb20aeb00314e915ecfefd86d26f46a\" ></escaped> .

Usage \u00b6 The preprocessor allows two syntax variants for include statements. The legacy syntax is simpler and shorter but less flexible. There are no plans to extend it. The new syntax introduced in version 1.1.0 is stricter and more flexible. It is more suitable for complex cases, and it can be easily extended in the future. This is the preferred syntax.

The New Syntax \u00b6 To enforce using the new syntax rules, put no content between <include>...</include> tags, and specify a local file or a file in a remote Git repository in tag attributes.

Note If you are using the new syntax, the src attribute is required to include a local file, and the repo_url and path attributes are required to include a file from a remote Git repository. All other attributes are optional. Note Foliant 1.0.9 supports the processing of attribute values as YAML. You can precede the values of attributes by the !path , !project_path , and !rel_path modifiers (i.e. YAML tags).

It may be useful in single-line table cells. Default value is false . project_root Path to the top-level (\u201croot\u201d) directory of Foliant project that the included file belongs to. This option may be needed to resolve the !path and !project_path modifiers in the included content properly. Note By default, if a local file is included, project_root points to the top-level directory of the current Foliant project, and if a file in a remote Git repository is referenced, project_root points to the top-level directory of this repository. In most cases you don\u2019t need to override the default behavior. Different options can be combined.

This can be implemented using <if></if> tag: Here is [ another page ]( < if backends = \"pandoc\" > # another_page </ if >< if backends = \"mkdocs\" > another_page . md </ if > ). This bulky construct quickly gets old when you use many cross-references in your documentation. To make your sources cleaner, move this construct to the config as a reusable macro: preprocessors : - macros : macros : ref : <if backends=\"pandoc\">{0}</if><if backends=\"mkdocs\">{1}</if> And use it in the source: Here is [ another page ]( < macro params = \"#another_page, another_page.md\" > ref </ macro > ).","title":"Usage"},{"location":"preprocessors/mermaid/","text":"Mermaid \u00b6 Mermaid Diagrams Preprocessor for Foliant \u00b6 Mermaid is an open source diagram visualization tool.

You can find it in the project URL, for example http://testrails.url/index.php?/projects/overview/17 <-. suite_ids If you have several suites in your project, you can download test cases from certain suites. You can find suite ID in the URL again, for example http://testrails.url/index.php?/suites/view/63... <-. section_ids Also you can download any sections you want regardless of it's level. Just keep in mind that this setting overrides previous suite_ids (but if you set suite_ids and then section_ids from another suite, nothing will be downloaded). And suddenly you can find section ID in it's URL, for example http://testrails.url/index.php?/suites/view/124&group_by=cases:section_id&group_order=asc&group_id=3926 <-. exclude_suite_ids You can exclude any suites (even stated in suite_ids ) from the document. exclude_section_ids The same with the sections. exclude_case_ids And the same with the cases. filename Path to the test cases file. It should be added to project chapters in foliant.yml . Default: test_cases.md . For example: title : &title Test procedure chapters : - intro.md - conditions.md - awesome_test_cases.md <- This one for test cases - appendum.md preprocessors : - testrail : testrail_url : http://testrails.url testrail_login : username testrail_pass : password project_id : 35 filename : awesome_test_cases.md rewrite_src_file You can update ( true ) test cases file after each use of preprocessor. Be careful, previous data will be deleted. template_folder Preprocessor uses Jinja2 templates to compose the file with test cases. Here you can find documentation: http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/ . You can store templates in folder inside the foliant project, but if it's not default case_templates you have to write it here. If this parameter not set and there is no default case_templates folder in the project, it will be created automatically with two jinja files for TestRail templates by default \u2014 Test Case (Text) with template_id=1 and Test Case (Steps) with template_id=2 . You can create TestRail templates by yourself in Administration panel, Customizations section, Templates part. Then you have to create jinja templates whith the names {template_id}.j2 for them. For example, file 2.j2 for Test Case (Steps) TestRail template: { % if case [ ' custom_steps_separated ' ][ 0 ][ ' content ' ] % } { % if case [ ' custom_preconds ' ] % } ** Preconditions : ** {{ case [ ' custom_preconds ' ] }} { % endif % } ** Scenario : ** { % for case_step in case [ ' custom_steps_separated ' ] % } * Step {{ loop . index }}. * {{ case_step [ ' content ' ] }} * Expected result : * {{ case_step [ ' expected ' ] }} { % endfor % } { % endif % } You can use all parameters of two variables in the template \u2014 case and params . Case parameters depends on TestRail template. All custom parameters have prefix 'custom_' before system name set in TestRail. Here is an example of case variable (parameters depends on case template): case = { 'created_by' : 3 , 'created_on' : 1524909903 , 'custom_expected' : None , 'custom_goals' : None , 'custom_mission' : None , 'custom_preconds' : '- The user is not registered in the system.\\r\\n' '- Registration form opened.' , 'custom_steps' : '' , 'custom_steps_separated' : [ { 'content' : 'Enter mobile phone number.' , 'expected' : '- Entered phone number ' 'is visible in the form field.' } , { 'content' : 'Press OK button.' , 'expected' : '- SMS with registration code ' 'received.\\n' } ], 'custom_test_androidtv' : None , 'custom_test_appletv' : None , 'custom_test_smarttv' : 'None, ' custom_tp ': True, ' estimate ': None, ' estimate_forecast ': None, ' id ': 15940, ' milestone_id ': None, ' priority_id ': 4, ' refs ': None, ' section_id ': 3441, ' suite_id ': 101, ' template_id ': 7, ' title ': ' Registration by mobile phone number . ', ' type_id ': 7, ' updated_by ': 10, ' updated_on ' : 1528978979 } And here is an example of params variable (parameters are always the same): params = { 'multi_param_name' : 'platform' , 'multi_param_sys_name' : 'custom_platform' , 'multi_param_select' : [ 'android' , 'ios' ], 'multi_param_select_type' : any , 'add_cases_without_multi_param' : False , 'checkbox_param_name' : 'publish' , 'checkbox_param_sys_name' : 'custom_publish' , 'checkbox_param_select_type' : 'checked' , 'choose_priorities' : [ 'critical' , 'high' , 'medium' ], 'add_multi_param_to_case_header' : True , 'add_multi_param_to_std_table' : True , 'add_priority_to_case_header' : True , 'add_priority_to_std_table' : True , 'add_case_id_to_case_header' : False , 'add_case_id_to_std_table' : False } Next three fields are necessary due localization issues. While markdown document with test cases is composed on the go, you have to set up some document headers. Definitely not the best solution in my life. section_header First level header of section with test cases. By default it's Testing program in Russian. add_std_table You can exclude ( false ) a testing table from the document. std_table_header First level header of section with test results table. By default it's Testing table in Russian. std_table_column_headers Semicolon separated headers of testing table columns. By default it's \u2116; Priority; Platform; ID; Test case name; Result; Comment in Russian. add_suite_headers With false you can exclude all suite headers from the final document. add_section_headers With false you can exclude all section headers from the final document. add_case_id_to_case_header Every test case in TestRail has unique ID, which, as usual, you can find in the header or test case URL: http://testrails.url/index.php?/cases/view/15920... <-. So you can add ( true ) this ID to the test case headers and testing table. Or not ( false ). add_case_id_to_std_table Also you can add ( true ) the column with the test case IDs to the testing table. In TestRail you can add custom parameters to your test case template. With next settings you can use one multi-select or dropdown (good for platforms, for example) and one checkbox (publishing) plus default priority parameter for cases sampling. multi_param_name Parameter name of multi-select or dropdown type you set in System Name field of Add Custom Field form in TestRail. For example, platforms with values Android , iOS , PC , Mac and web . If multi_param_select not set, all test cases will be downloaded (useful when you need just to add parameter value to the test headers or testing table). multi_param_select Here you can set the platforms for which you want to get test cases (case insensitive). For example, you have similar UX for mobile platforms and want to combine them: preprocessors : - testrail : ... multi_param_name : platforms multi_param_select : android, ios ... multi_param_select_type With this parameter you can make test cases sampling in different ways. It has several options: any (by default) \u2014 at least one of multi_param_select values should be set for the case, all \u2014 all of multi_param_select values should be set and any other can be set for the case, only \u2014 only multi_param_select values in any combination should be set for the case, match \u2014 all and only multi_param_select values should be set for the case. With multi_param_select: android, ios we will get the following cases: Test cases Android iOS PC Mac web any all only match Test case 1 + + + + + + Test case 2 + + + + + + Test case 3 + + Test case 4 + + + + Test case 5 + + + + + Test case 6 + + + + + Test case 7 + + + Test case 8 + + + Test case 9 + + + add_cases_without_multi_param Also you can include (by default) or exclude ( false ) cases without any value of multi-select or dropdown parameter. add_multi_param_to_case_header You can add ( true ) values of multi-select or dropdown parameter to the case headers or not (by default). add_multi_param_to_std_table You can add ( true ) column with values of multi-select or dropdown parameter to the testing table or not (by default). checkbox_param_name Parameter name of checkbox type you set in System Name field of Add Custom Field form in TestRail. For example, publish . Without parameter name set all of cases will be downloaded. checkbox_param_select_type With this parameter you can make test cases sampling in different ways. It has several options: checked (by default) \u2014 only cases whith checked field will be downloaded, unchecked \u2014 only cases whith unchecked field will be downloaded. choose_priorities Here you can set test case priorities to download (case insensitive). preprocessors : - testrail : ... choose_priorities : critical, high, medium ... add_priority_to_case_header You can add ( true ) priority to the case headers or not (by default). add_priority_to_std_table You can add ( true ) column with case priority to the testing table or not (by default). Using described setting you can flexibly adjust test cases sampling. For example, you can download only published critical test cases for both and only Mac and PC . Now strange things, mostly made specially for my project, but may be useful for others. Screenshots. There is no possibility to store screenshots in TestRail projects, but you can store them in the GitLab repository (link to which should be stated in one of the following parameters). GitLab project should have following structure: images / \u251c\u2500\u2500 smarttv / | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot1_smarttv . png | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot2_smarttv . png | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 androidtv / | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot1_androidtv . png | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot2_androidtv . png | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 appletv / | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot1_appletv . png | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot2_appletv . png | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 web / | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot1_web . png | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot2_web . png | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot1 . png \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot2 . png \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... images folder used for projects without platforms. Filename ending is a first value of multi_param_select parameter ( platform ). Now to add screenshot to your document just add following string to the test case (unfortunately, in TestRail interface it will looks like broken image link): ( leading exclamation mark here ! )[ Image title ]( main_filename_part ) Preprocessor will convert to the following format: https : // gitlab . url / gitlab_group_name / gitlab_project_name / raw / master / images / platform_name / main_filename_part_platform_name . png For example, in the project with multi_param_select: smarttv the string ( leading exclamation mark here ! )[ Application main screen ]( main_screen ) will be converted to: ( leading exclamation mark here ! )[ Application main screen ]( https : // gitlab . url / documentation / application - screenshots / raw / master / images / smarttv / main_screen_smarttv . png ) That's it. resolve_urls Turn on ( true ) or off ( false , by default) image urls resolving. screenshots_url GitLab repository URL, in our example: https://gitlab.url/documentation/application-screenshots/ . screenshots_ext Screenshots extension. Yes, it must be only one and the same for all screenshots. And the last one emergency tool. If you have no jinja template for any type of TestRail case, you'll see this message like this: There is no jinja template for test case template_id 5 (case_id 1325) in folder case_templates . So you have to write jinja template by yourself. To do this it's necessary to know case structure. This parameter shows it to you. print_case_structure Turn on ( true ) or off ( false , by default) printing out of case structure with all data in it if any problem occurs. Usage \u00b6 Just add the preprocessor to the project config, set it up and enjoy the automatically collected test cases to your document. Tips \u00b6 In some cases you may encounter a problem with test cases text format, so composed markdown file will be converted to the document with bad formatting. In this cases replace preprocessor could be useful: https://foliant-docs.github.io/docs/preprocessors/replace/ .","title":"Testrail"},{"location":"preprocessors/testrail/#testrail","text":"TestRail preprocessor collects test cases from TestRail project and adds to your testing procedure document.","title":"Testrail"},{"location":"preprocessors/testrail/#installation","text":"$ pip install foliantcontrib.testrail","title":"Installation"},{"location":"preprocessors/testrail/#config","text":"To enable the preprocessor, add testrail to preprocessors section in the project config. The preprocessor has a number of options (best values are set by default where possible): preprocessors : - testrail : testrail_url : http://testrails.url \\\\ Required testrail_login : username \\\\ Required testrail_pass : password \\\\ Required project_id : 35 \\\\ Required suite_ids : \\\\ Optional section_ids : \\\\ Optional exclude_suite_ids : \\\\ Optional exclude_section_ids : \\\\ Optional exclude_case_ids : \\\\ Optional filename : test_cases.md \\\\ Optional rewrite_src_file : false \\\\ Optional template_folder : case_templates \\\\ Optional section_header : Testing program \\\\ Recommended add_std_table : true \\\\ Optional std_table_header : Table with testing results \\\\ Recommended std_table_column_headers : \u2116; Priority; Platform; ID; Test case name; Result; Comment \\\\ Recommended add_suite_headers : true \\\\ Optional add_section_headers : true \\\\ Optional add_case_id_to_case_header : false \\\\ Optional add_case_id_to_std_table : false \\\\ Optional multi_param_name : \\\\ Optional multi_param_select : \\\\ Optional multi_param_select_type : any \\\\ Optional add_cases_without_multi_param : true \\\\ Optional add_multi_param_to_case_header : false \\\\ Optional add_multi_param_to_std_table : false \\\\ Optional checkbox_param_name : \\\\ Optional checkbox_param_select_type : checked \\\\ Optional choose_priorities : \\\\ Optional add_priority_to_case_header : false \\\\ Optional add_priority_to_std_table : false \\\\ Optional resolve_urls : true \\\\ Optional screenshots_url : https://gitlab_repository.url \\\\ Optional screenshots_ext : .png \\\\ Optional print_case_structure : true \\\\ For debugging testrail_url URL of TestRail deployed. testrail_login Your TestRail username. testrail_pass Your TestRail password. project_id TestRail project ID. You can find it in the project URL, for example http://testrails.url/index.php?/projects/overview/17 <-. suite_ids If you have several suites in your project, you can download test cases from certain suites. You can find suite ID in the URL again, for example http://testrails.url/index.php?/suites/view/63... <-. section_ids Also you can download any sections you want regardless of it's level. Just keep in mind that this setting overrides previous suite_ids (but if you set suite_ids and then section_ids from another suite, nothing will be downloaded). And suddenly you can find section ID in it's URL, for example http://testrails.url/index.php?/suites/view/124&group_by=cases:section_id&group_order=asc&group_id=3926 <-. exclude_suite_ids You can exclude any suites (even stated in suite_ids ) from the document. exclude_section_ids The same with the sections. exclude_case_ids And the same with the cases. filename Path to the test cases file. It should be added to project chapters in foliant.yml . Default: test_cases.md . For example: title : &title Test procedure chapters : - intro.md - conditions.md - awesome_test_cases.md <- This one for test cases - appendum.md preprocessors : - testrail : testrail_url : http://testrails.url testrail_login : username testrail_pass : password project_id : 35 filename : awesome_test_cases.md rewrite_src_file You can update ( true ) test cases file after each use of preprocessor. Be careful, previous data will be deleted. template_folder Preprocessor uses Jinja2 templates to compose the file with test cases. Here you can find documentation: http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/ . You can store templates in folder inside the foliant project, but if it's not default case_templates you have to write it here. If this parameter not set and there is no default case_templates folder in the project, it will be created automatically with two jinja files for TestRail templates by default \u2014 Test Case (Text) with template_id=1 and Test Case (Steps) with template_id=2 . You can create TestRail templates by yourself in Administration panel, Customizations section, Templates part. Then you have to create jinja templates whith the names {template_id}.j2 for them. For example, file 2.j2 for Test Case (Steps) TestRail template: { % if case [ ' custom_steps_separated ' ][ 0 ][ ' content ' ] % } { % if case [ ' custom_preconds ' ] % } ** Preconditions : ** {{ case [ ' custom_preconds ' ] }} { % endif % } ** Scenario : ** { % for case_step in case [ ' custom_steps_separated ' ] % } * Step {{ loop . index }}. * {{ case_step [ ' content ' ] }} * Expected result : * {{ case_step [ ' expected ' ] }} { % endfor % } { % endif % } You can use all parameters of two variables in the template \u2014 case and params . Case parameters depends on TestRail template. All custom parameters have prefix 'custom_' before system name set in TestRail. Here is an example of case variable (parameters depends on case template): case = { 'created_by' : 3 , 'created_on' : 1524909903 , 'custom_expected' : None , 'custom_goals' : None , 'custom_mission' : None , 'custom_preconds' : '- The user is not registered in the system.\\r\\n' '- Registration form opened.' , 'custom_steps' : '' , 'custom_steps_separated' : [ { 'content' : 'Enter mobile phone number.' , 'expected' : '- Entered phone number ' 'is visible in the form field.' } , { 'content' : 'Press OK button.' , 'expected' : '- SMS with registration code ' 'received.\\n' } ], 'custom_test_androidtv' : None , 'custom_test_appletv' : None , 'custom_test_smarttv' : 'None, ' custom_tp ': True, ' estimate ': None, ' estimate_forecast ': None, ' id ': 15940, ' milestone_id ': None, ' priority_id ': 4, ' refs ': None, ' section_id ': 3441, ' suite_id ': 101, ' template_id ': 7, ' title ': ' Registration by mobile phone number . ', ' type_id ': 7, ' updated_by ': 10, ' updated_on ' : 1528978979 } And here is an example of params variable (parameters are always the same): params = { 'multi_param_name' : 'platform' , 'multi_param_sys_name' : 'custom_platform' , 'multi_param_select' : [ 'android' , 'ios' ], 'multi_param_select_type' : any , 'add_cases_without_multi_param' : False , 'checkbox_param_name' : 'publish' , 'checkbox_param_sys_name' : 'custom_publish' , 'checkbox_param_select_type' : 'checked' , 'choose_priorities' : [ 'critical' , 'high' , 'medium' ], 'add_multi_param_to_case_header' : True , 'add_multi_param_to_std_table' : True , 'add_priority_to_case_header' : True , 'add_priority_to_std_table' : True , 'add_case_id_to_case_header' : False , 'add_case_id_to_std_table' : False } Next three fields are necessary due localization issues. While markdown document with test cases is composed on the go, you have to set up some document headers. Definitely not the best solution in my life. section_header First level header of section with test cases. By default it's Testing program in Russian. add_std_table You can exclude ( false ) a testing table from the document. std_table_header First level header of section with test results table. By default it's Testing table in Russian. std_table_column_headers Semicolon separated headers of testing table columns. By default it's \u2116; Priority; Platform; ID; Test case name; Result; Comment in Russian. add_suite_headers With false you can exclude all suite headers from the final document. add_section_headers With false you can exclude all section headers from the final document. add_case_id_to_case_header Every test case in TestRail has unique ID, which, as usual, you can find in the header or test case URL: http://testrails.url/index.php?/cases/view/15920... <-. So you can add ( true ) this ID to the test case headers and testing table. Or not ( false ). add_case_id_to_std_table Also you can add ( true ) the column with the test case IDs to the testing table. In TestRail you can add custom parameters to your test case template. With next settings you can use one multi-select or dropdown (good for platforms, for example) and one checkbox (publishing) plus default priority parameter for cases sampling. multi_param_name Parameter name of multi-select or dropdown type you set in System Name field of Add Custom Field form in TestRail. For example, platforms with values Android , iOS , PC , Mac and web . If multi_param_select not set, all test cases will be downloaded (useful when you need just to add parameter value to the test headers or testing table). multi_param_select Here you can set the platforms for which you want to get test cases (case insensitive). For example, you have similar UX for mobile platforms and want to combine them: preprocessors : - testrail : ... multi_param_name : platforms multi_param_select : android, ios ... multi_param_select_type With this parameter you can make test cases sampling in different ways. It has several options: any (by default) \u2014 at least one of multi_param_select values should be set for the case, all \u2014 all of multi_param_select values should be set and any other can be set for the case, only \u2014 only multi_param_select values in any combination should be set for the case, match \u2014 all and only multi_param_select values should be set for the case. With multi_param_select: android, ios we will get the following cases: Test cases Android iOS PC Mac web any all only match Test case 1 + + + + + + Test case 2 + + + + + + Test case 3 + + Test case 4 + + + + Test case 5 + + + + + Test case 6 + + + + + Test case 7 + + + Test case 8 + + + Test case 9 + + + add_cases_without_multi_param Also you can include (by default) or exclude ( false ) cases without any value of multi-select or dropdown parameter. add_multi_param_to_case_header You can add ( true ) values of multi-select or dropdown parameter to the case headers or not (by default). add_multi_param_to_std_table You can add ( true ) column with values of multi-select or dropdown parameter to the testing table or not (by default). checkbox_param_name Parameter name of checkbox type you set in System Name field of Add Custom Field form in TestRail. For example, publish . Without parameter name set all of cases will be downloaded. checkbox_param_select_type With this parameter you can make test cases sampling in different ways. It has several options: checked (by default) \u2014 only cases whith checked field will be downloaded, unchecked \u2014 only cases whith unchecked field will be downloaded. choose_priorities Here you can set test case priorities to download (case insensitive). preprocessors : - testrail : ... choose_priorities : critical, high, medium ... add_priority_to_case_header You can add ( true ) priority to the case headers or not (by default). add_priority_to_std_table You can add ( true ) column with case priority to the testing table or not (by default). Using described setting you can flexibly adjust test cases sampling. For example, you can download only published critical test cases for both and only Mac and PC . Now strange things, mostly made specially for my project, but may be useful for others. Screenshots. There is no possibility to store screenshots in TestRail projects, but you can store them in the GitLab repository (link to which should be stated in one of the following parameters). GitLab project should have following structure: images / \u251c\u2500\u2500 smarttv / | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot1_smarttv . png | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot2_smarttv . png | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 androidtv / | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot1_androidtv . png | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot2_androidtv . png | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 appletv / | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot1_appletv . png | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot2_appletv . png | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 web / | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot1_web . png | \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot2_web . png | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot1 . png \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshot2 . png \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... images folder used for projects without platforms. Filename ending is a first value of multi_param_select parameter ( platform ). Now to add screenshot to your document just add following string to the test case (unfortunately, in TestRail interface it will looks like broken image link): ( leading exclamation mark here ! )[ Image title ]( main_filename_part ) Preprocessor will convert to the following format: https : // gitlab . url / gitlab_group_name / gitlab_project_name / raw / master / images / platform_name / main_filename_part_platform_name . png For example, in the project with multi_param_select: smarttv the string ( leading exclamation mark here ! )[ Application main screen ]( main_screen ) will be converted to: ( leading exclamation mark here ! )[ Application main screen ]( https : // gitlab . url / documentation / application - screenshots / raw / master / images / smarttv / main_screen_smarttv . png ) That's it. resolve_urls Turn on ( true ) or off ( false , by default) image urls resolving. screenshots_url GitLab repository URL, in our example: https://gitlab.url/documentation/application-screenshots/ . screenshots_ext Screenshots extension. Yes, it must be only one and the same for all screenshots. And the last one emergency tool. If you have no jinja template for any type of TestRail case, you'll see this message like this: There is no jinja template for test case template_id 5 (case_id 1325) in folder case_templates . So you have to write jinja template by yourself. To do this it's necessary to know case structure. This parameter shows it to you. print_case_structure Turn on ( true ) or off ( false , by default) printing out of case structure with all data in it if any problem occurs.","title":"Config"},{"location":"preprocessors/testrail/#usage","text":"Just add the preprocessor to the project config, set it up and enjoy the automatically collected test cases to your document.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"preprocessors/testrail/#tips","text":"In some cases you may encounter a problem with test cases text format, so composed markdown file will be converted to the document with bad formatting.
